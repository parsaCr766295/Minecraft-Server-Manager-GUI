This is a placeholder for a Windows shortcut file.

To create a proper shortcut:
1. Right-click on launch.bat
2. Select "Create shortcut"
3. Rename the shortcut to "Minecraft Server Manager"
4. Optionally, right-click the shortcut, select Properties, and change the icon

Note: .lnk files cannot be created directly through text editing, which is why this is a .txt file.
